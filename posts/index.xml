<p>But not necessarily less colors equals easier time&hellip; games are such a hard medium to create things on, it involves many competences. Drawings and rendering is just part of it.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re indoor druids, as the name says, we are druids but we don&rsquo;t touch grass that much&hellip;</p>

<p>So welcome aboard! Soon we will start to share news with everyone.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
